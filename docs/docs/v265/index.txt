intro/Overview.htm := Overview Back Overview JS Py Hello World Content: - Scripting Framework - App Icons - Editing Scripts - Samples - Measurements - Getting Started Scripting Framework The DroidScript App contains a scripting framework which allows anyone with a bit of JavaScript knowledge to easily write Apps for their mobile phone or tablet. You can write very simple Apps with just a few buttons, or more complex ones which include dynamic graphical interfaces such as the DroidScript application itself, which is written using the very same framework. As well as creating graphical interfaces, you have access to Sensors like the Accelerometer, Compass, Light meter or other device components like Wifi, Bluetooth, Camera, GPS, SD Card, SMS, Emails, Internet and more. We're always adding new functionality to the framework, so if you want something added just let us know via email or leave a comment on the forum. App Icons When you first start DroidScript, you will see a series of icons used to run your JavaScript Apps. There will initially be a simple 'Hello World' example App here for you try. You can launch the App by simply touching the icon. After you have finished with an App, press the phone's 'back' button to return to the main screen. Long press an App's icon to see other available actions. Editing Scripts You can edit Apps right here on your phone or tablet using the built-in script editor by long pressing on the App's icon and selecting the 'Edit' option. You can also edit your Apps on a PC or Mac in a browser using the built in Wifi editor, by touching the small arrow button at the top and following the instructions shown. Editing with a full size keyboard is much easier and we recommend that you use the WiFi editing for long coding sessions, especially for larger projects. The Wifi editor also allows you to easily upload image and sound resources to your App. Samples DroidScript comes with many sample Apps, ranging from very simple "Hello World" type Apps which show a single button to more complex ones which involve Web pages, Wifi and Phone-PC communication. It's a good idea to copy the script in one of these samples as a starting point for your own Apps. Try to find the one which best matches your requirements. Have a look at them right now! Measurements In order to maintain the scale of graphical objects in devices with different screen resolutions and orientations, all positioning and sizing values are given as a decimal fraction of the screen width or height. For example creating a button with a width of 0.5 would make the button half the screen width and using a height of 0.1 would make the button one tenth of screen height. You can however specify -1 or leave out the width and height parameters completely on many controls if you want the control to size according to its contents. Getting Started Before starting to write your own Apps it's a good idea to read the documentation explaining 'Layouts' as these are a fundamental part of every DroidScript App.
intro/AppTypes.htm := App Types Back App Types JS Py Hello World Content: • Overview • Html • Native • Node Native • Hybrid Overview Feature \ App Type HTML Native Node Native Hybrid Native Methods Native UI HTML / CSS UI via WebView Component via WebView Component MUI Components Node.js via NodeJS Component via NodeJS Component via NodeJS Component Cross Platform Environment Android WebView Android WebView NodeJS Android WebView Minimum APK Size low (4MB) low (4MB) high (30MB) moderate (10MB) Html An 'HTML' app is simply a foreground Android Webview showing a standard HTML/CSS/JS (web style) user interface. It can make app.* native Android calls via the JavaScript→Native bridge. Advantages: - standard web technologies and libraries to create UI. - well documented in the web (W3Schools) - Small APK size and memory usage Disadvantages: - More time consuming to develop, HTML/CSS experience required - No native 'look and feel' of Android Native A 'Native' app uses an invisible Android Webview to run the main JavaScript code, but the app's user interface is created with native Android controls via calls across the JS→Native bridge. Advantages: - Simple to use - Direct access to browser features as Android WebView evolves (i.E. WebBluetooth, Canvas, WebAssembly, WebRTC) - Small APK size and memory usage Disadvantages: - The performance is slower for complex UI (can be improved with cfg.Fast at the loss of DOM objects) - Modern browser features might not work with older WebView versions Node Native A 'Node Native' app runs the main JavaScript code inside a standard NodeJS instance instead of the WebView. User interface is made using native Android controls which are accessed using app.* methods. These native calls run via a custom NodeJS extension instead of the Js→Native bridge. Advantages: - Native UI + powerful server/IOT functionality all in one - Access to many thousands of free 'npm' modules for extending app functionality - Higher performance when creating complex native user interfaces Disadvantage: - Large APK size, more memory usage Hybrid A 'Hybrid' app runs the main JavaScript code inside a foreground Android WebView, the users creates the UI programatically like with 'Native' apps, but it's rendered inside the same WebView using HTML/CSS instead of using native Android controls across the bridge. Advantages: - Simple and fast to use - WYSIWYG editor available - Industry standard 'Material' look and feel - Low memory usage, Smaller APK - Cross-Platform compatible, since it is just HTML/CSS in the background - No JS→Native bridge required for rendering UI (build complex UI faster) - Switch between light and dark theme at runtime Disadvantages: - Fewer customization options for look and feel - app.* and NodeJS features break cross-platform compatibility
intro/AppEvents.htm := App Events Back App Events JS Py Hello World Content: - OnStart() - OnMenu(name) - OnBack() - OnPause() - OnResume() - OnConfig() - OnAlarm() - OnData() - OnDrawer(side, state) In your app you can use various event functions which will be automatically called by DroidScript. OnStart() This is probably the most popular one. It will be called when DroidScript has initialized and it is the last function which will be called from global scope. That means every timeout you might have set will be called after OnStart was called. When OnStart has returned, the apps 'started' state will be set to true. Therefore app.IsStarted() method will return true as well. Example - OnStart setTimeout(OnLoad); function OnStart() { alert("called OnStart\nApp Started: " + app.IsStarted()); } function OnLoad() { alert("called OnLoad\nApp Started: " + app.IsStarted()); } setTimeout(OnLoad) def OnStart(): alert("called OnStart\nApp Started: " + app.IsStarted()) def OnLoad(): alert("called OnLoad\nApp Started: " + app.IsStarted()) Copy Copy All Run OnMenu(name) This event is called when the user selects an item from the in-app menu. See Also: SetMenu, ShowMenu Example - OnMenu function OnStart() { app.SetMenu( "Start,Stop,Pause" ); lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "" ); btn = app.CreateButton( "[fa-gear]", -1, -1, "fontawesome" ); btn.SetOnTouch( app.ShowMenu ); lay.AddChild( btn ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function OnMenu( item ) { app.ShowPopup( item, "Short" ); } def OnStart(): app.SetMenu( "Start,Stop,Pause" ) lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "" ) btn = app.CreateButton( "[fa-gear]", -1, -1, "fontawesome" ) btn.SetOnTouch( app.ShowMenu ) lay.AddChild( btn ) app.AddLayout( lay ) def OnMenu( item ): app.ShowPopup( item, "Short" ) Copy Copy All Run OnBack() By default the app closes if the user presses the devices back-button. However, you can disable that behaviour by calling app.EnableBackKey(false). In this case the OnBack event will be called instead of closing the app. This can be useful to create a confirmation dialog before exiting: Example - Confirm Exit function OnStart() { app.EnableBackKey( false ); yndExit = app.CreateYesNoDialog("Exit App?"); yndExit.SetOnTouch( yndExit_OnTouch ); app.ShowPopup( "Press the back button" ); } function yndExit_OnTouch(reply) { if(reply == "Yes") app.Exit(); } function OnBack() { yndExit.Show(); } def OnStart(): app.EnableBackKey( false ) yndExit = app.CreateYesNoDialog("Exit App?") yndExit.SetOnTouch( yndExit_OnTouch ) app.ShowPopup( "Press the back button" ) def yndExit_OnTouch(reply): if reply == "Yes": app.Exit() def OnBack(): yndExit.Show() Copy Copy All Run OnPause() The OnPause event will be called when the user sends the app to the background, ie. when pressing the home button. Example - Detect Pause //Called when application is paused. function OnPause() { app.ShowPopup( "OnPause" ); } # Called when application is paused. def OnPause(): app.ShowPopup( "OnPause" ) Copy All Run OnResume() The OnResume event will be called when the user returns to your app after sending it to the background. Example - Detect Resume //Called when application is resumed. function OnResume() { app.ShowPopup( "OnResume" ); } # Called when application is resumed. def OnResume(): app.ShowPopup( "OnResume" ) Copy All Run OnConfig() OnConfig is called when a device configuration changes, especially the screen orientation. This can be used to rearrange your layouts on orientation change. Example - Layout Orientation function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); txt1 = app.CreateText( "" ); txt1.SetTextSize( 64 ); lay.AddChild( txt1 ); txt2 = app.CreateText( "" ); txt2.SetTextSize( 64 ); lay.AddChild( txt2 ); OnConfig(); app.AddLayout( lay ); } //Called when screen rotates function OnConfig() { var orient = app.GetOrientation(); txt1.SetText(orient); if(orient == "Portrait") orient = "Vertical"; else orient = "Horizontal"; lay.SetOrientation( orient ); txt2.SetText( orient ); } def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) txt1 = app.CreateText( "" ) txt1.SetTextSize( 64 ) lay.AddChild( txt1 ) txt2 = app.CreateText( "" ) txt2.SetTextSize( 64 ) lay.AddChild( txt2 ) OnConfig() app.AddLayout( lay ) # Called when screen rotates def OnConfig(): orient = app.GetOrientation() txt1.SetText(orient) if orient == "Portrait": orient = "Vertical" else: orient = "Horizontal" lay.SetOrientation( orient ) txt2.SetText( orient ) Copy Copy All Run OnAlarm() If you have set up an app Alarm and it is triggered it will call the OnAlarm event. Example - OnAlarm function OnStart() { var now = Date.now(); app.SetAlarm( "Set", 1234, OnAlarm, Date.now() + 3000 ); // app.ToBack(); // app.Exit(); } //Called when alarm is triggered. //(Even if your app is closed) function OnAlarm( id ) { app.ShowPopup( "Got Alarm: id = " + id ); } def OnStart(): now = Date.now() app.SetAlarm( "Set", 1234, OnAlarm, Date.now() + 3000 ) # app.ToBack() # app.Exit() # Called when alarm is triggered. # (Even if your app is closed) def OnAlarm( id ): app.ShowPopup( "Got Alarm: id = " + id ) Copy Copy All Run OnData() When an other app has sent an intent to your app you will get notified by the OnData event. Then you can retrieve the intent object using the app.GetIntent() method. Example - Received Intent Data //Handle data sent from other apps. function OnData( isStartUp ) { //Display intent data. var intent = app.GetIntent(); if( intent ) { //Extract main data. var s = "action: " + intent.action + "\n"; s += "type: " + intent.type + "\n"; s += "data: " + intent.data + "\n\n"; //Extract extras. s += "extras:\n"; for( var key in intent.extras ) s += key+": "+intent.extras[key] + "\n"; app.Alert( s, "OnData" ); } } # Handle data sent from other apps. def OnData( isStartUp ): # Display intent data. intent = app.GetIntent() if intent : # Extract main data. s = "action: " + intent.action + "\n" s += "type: " + intent.type + "\n" s += "data: " + intent.data + "\n\n" # Extract extras. s += "extras:\n" for key in intent.extras : s += key+": "+intent.extras[key] + "\n" app.Alert( s, "OnData" ) Copy All Run OnDrawer(side, state) When the user opens or closes a drawer the OnDrawer callback is called. state can be “Open” or “Closed” side can be “Left” or “Right”
intro/SavingData.htm := Saving Data Back Saving Data JS Py Hello World Content: • Save data during one session • Save data across multiple app starts • Using Databases In many cases you need to store user specific data like app settings on the users device. DroidScript provides some functions which makes it easier to handle this. Note: All explained methods are listed in the Database section. Save data during one session Some settings are just meaningful in a current running program. For example if you keep track of the current app state (opened tabs, documents, pages). For this purpose you can use the app.SetData and the app.GetData method. To clear stored data use app.ClearData. Save data across multiple app starts Many apps support in-app settings which will be loaded after each app start. The app object has several methods to save and load different types of data. To clear a saved value use the app.ClearValue method. Type Save Load Boolean SaveBoolean LoadBoolean Number SaveNumber LoadNumber String SaveText LoadText JSON (any) SaveJson LoadJson If you have many properties to save you can use an object structure instead of saving each value on their own. Load settings: var conf = JSON.parse( app.LoadText( "settings", "{}" )); Save settings: app.SaveText( "settings", JSON.stringify( conf )); Example - App Settings // default settings var settings = { version: "1.0", startNo: 0 }; function LoadSettings() { var tmp = JSON.parse(app.LoadText( "settings", "{}" )); // update settings object for(var i in tmp) settings[i] = tmp[i]; } function SaveSettings() { app.SaveText( "settings", JSON.stringify(settings) ); } function OnStart() { LoadSettings(); settings.startNo++; app.ShowPopup("Started " + settings.startNo + ". time"); SaveSettings(); } # default settings settings =version: "1.0", startNo: 0 def LoadSettings(): tmp = JSON.parse(app.LoadText( "settings", "" )) # update settings object for i in tmp: settings[i] = tmp[i] def SaveSettings(): app.SaveText( "settings", JSON.stringify(settings) ) def OnStart(): LoadSettings() settings.startNo++ app.ShowPopup("Started " + settings.startNo + ". time") SaveSettings() Copy Copy All Run Using Databases Using Databases is the most elaborate variant of the three. You should only consider using one if you have to perform complex queries on a large amount of datasets. Using JSON objects is more practicable and performant in most cases. DroidScript provides an extra OpenDatabase component for databases which uses the SQLitePlugin cordova-sqlite-storage. For a demo Have a look at the Database example.
intro/CodingFeatures.htm := Coding Features Back Coding Features JS Py Hello World Content: • The cfg object • app.eventSource • Function Shortcuts • Permissions • Translations: T() • Unique Callbacks: I() - Custom Contexts: M() - obj.data DroidScript provides some methods and flags in the sourcecode which are not available in regular JavaScript code but are interpreted internally by DroidScript. You don't necessarily need to use these features but they are still pretty useful in some cases. The cfg object The cfg object can be used to apply app options to your app before it is launched. They should be placed at the very top of your main source script. cfg.Portrait/Landscape Defines the initial screen orientation your app will launch in cfg.Holo cfg.Light cfg.Dark These settings will change the look of all your controls. Holo was the default theme until DS 1.90 beta, where cfg.Light and cfg.Dark were added and cfg.Dark became the dark theme. Note that only Light and Dark theme can be exchanged securely, Holo might cause broken UI in some cases when switching to Light or Dark. cfg.Node Runs the app in NodeJS mode. cfg.MUI Enables builtin material component support through the MUI object. Note: This function is a premium feature. Please consider subscribing to Premium to use this feature and support DroidScript in its further development. cfg.Game The Game configuration will let your app immediately run in GameView mode. This way you can write your game code directly in the main script without bothering about creating the GameView container. cfg.Transparent This will let your app run transparently on the HomeScreen and it will stay on top of everything even if the user launches an other app. Note: This function is a premium feature. Please consider subscribing to Premium to use this feature and support DroidScript in its further development. cfg.Serv The Serv flag will serve any HTML or Hybrid app over a builtin HTTP server on port 3033. cfg.Console This will show the console as main page instead of the GUI. Drawers will still work with this config. cfg.NoSwapify This option prevents function name swapping during obfuscation cfg.Legacy Enables various legacy transparent app behaviour --> cfg.Fast The Fast config will make use of the J2V8 engine which increases the apps execution speed roughly by a factor of 3. Specifically it will increase the speed of app.* calls, which is quite useful for tween animations or when creating and modifying a huge amount of app controls. The drawback of this method is that all default WebView DOM objects are not available any more. This includes methods like setInterval and setTimeout which should be converted to app.Animate respectively. Note: The same effect can be observed when running in a Node.js environment (using the cfg.Node flag) app.eventSource In callback functions of controls you can use app.eventSource to access the callee control object without having to assign the control to a specific variable. Previously this could be achieved by using the this keyword. This allows you to create multiple controls with the same behaviour without having to redefine callback functions for different controls: Example - Use Case of this function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout("Linear", "FillXY,VCenter"); lay.SetChildMargins(0, 0.03); for(var i = 1; i = 5; i++) { var btn = app.AddButton(lay, i, 0.6); btn.SetOnTouch(btnN_OnTouch); } app.AddLayout(lay); } function btnN_OnTouch() { // app.eventSource == this app.ShowPopup("Hello " + app.eventSource.GetText()); } def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout("Linear", "FillXY,VCenter") lay.SetChildMargins(0, 0.03) for i = 1; i = 5; i++: btn = app.AddButton(lay, i, 0.6) btn.SetOnTouch(btnN_OnTouch) app.AddLayout(lay) def btnN_OnTouch(): # app.eventSource == this app.ShowPopup("Hello " + app.eventSource.GetText()) Copy All Run Function Shortcuts There are shortcuts to certain functions, which are DW() => app.GetDisplayWidth() DH() => app.GetDisplayHeight() TW( txt, size) => app.GetTextBounds( txt, size, 0, null).width _PlaySound( file) _GetRandomColor(): color RGB( r, g, b): color atob2(): base64 . Permissions These methods can force DroidScript to add or remove specific permissions from your app. See also: GetPermission, CheckPermission Translations: T() Converts a keyword into the translated text using a lang.json file. Unique Callbacks: I() DroidScript checks if a callback function already exists and uses it instead of creating a new instance. This can cause issues when referring to other local variables in private scopes. Therefore you can wrap your callback functions in an I() clause to force DroidScript to create a new callback instance for that scope. Example - Using I() function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); NewButton("Button 1", lay); NewButton("Button 2", lay); NewButton2("Button 1", lay); NewButton2("Button 2", lay); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function NewButton(name, lay) { var btn = app.AddButton( lay, name, 0.3, 0.1 ); btn.SetMargins( 0, 0, 0, 0.02 ); btn.SetTextColor( "red" ); btn.SetOnTouch( function() { app.ShowPopup(name); }); } function NewButton2(name, lay) { var btn = app.AddButton( name, 0.3, 0.1 ); btn.SetTextColor( "green" ); btn.SetMargins( 0, 0.02 ); btn.SetOnTouch( I(function() { app.ShowPopup(name); })); } def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) NewButton("Button 1", lay) NewButton("Button 2", lay) NewButton2("Button 1", lay) NewButton2("Button 2", lay) app.AddLayout( lay ) def NewButton(name, lay): btn = app.AddButton( lay, name, 0.3, 0.1 ) btn.SetMargins( 0, 0, 0, 0.02 ) btn.SetTextColor( "red" ) btn.SetOnTouch( function() app.ShowPopup(name);) def NewButton2(name, lay): btn = app.AddButton( name, 0.3, 0.1 ) btn.SetTextColor( "green" ) btn.SetMargins( 0, 0.02 ) btn.SetOnTouch( I(function() app.ShowPopup(name);)) Copy Copy All Run Custom Contexts: M() The M() macro is equivalent to the I() macro, except that it accepts a custom 'this' context as first argument. obj.data Alternatively you can make use of the controls data property and the this keyword in callbacks. This way you can assign variables to the object they belong to and you still make use of the callback optimization by DroidScript: Example - Using this.data function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); NewButton2("Button 1", lay); NewButton2("Button 2", lay); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function NewButton2(name, lay) { btn = app.AddButton( lay, name, 0.3, 0.1 ); btn.SetTextColor( "green" ); btn.SetMargins( 0, 0.02 ); btn.data.name = name; btn.SetOnTouch( function() { app.ShowPopup(this.data.name); }); } def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) NewButton2("Button 1", lay) NewButton2("Button 2", lay) app.AddLayout( lay ) def NewButton2(name, lay): btn = app.AddButton( lay, name, 0.3, 0.1 ) btn.SetTextColor( "green" ) btn.SetMargins( 0, 0.02 ) btn.data.name = name btn.SetOnTouch( function() app.ShowPopup(this.data.name);) Copy Copy All Run
intro/WritingDSPlugins.htm := Writing DS Plugins Back Writing DS Plugins JS Py Hello World Content: • JavaScript Plugins • Java Plugins - Structure - Compile and Install - Communicate with your Java code DroidScript can't do everything imaginable. But you can help it to come closer to that by writing plugins. There are basically two types of plugins: JavaScript plugins which will behave like an extra included JS source script and Java plugins, which have a second compiled part written in java. JavaScript Plugins A basic JS plugin consists of 2 parts: - a MyPlugin.inc file containing the main JS source code - a MyPlugin.html file containing the main page of your plugin documentation. However you can add as many resources to it as you want. There is a generator available which can create, debug and install plugins on the fly. you can even debug your plugin directly from that app. Download it from the dspk store Java Plugins Writing java plugins is a bit tricky but once you get used to it you can get almost everything working. Structure There are two types of Java plugin packages: 1. The standard zip file: - contains a MyPlugin.inc and a MyPlugin.html file as JS plugins - a MyPlugin.jar file which contains the compiled classes.dex file. 2. An APK file: - an assets/ folder containing the MyPlugin.inc and the MyPlugin.html file - a compiled classes.dex file APK files are typically exported by AndroidStudio, AIDE and others. That leads us to the ways how you can write and more importantly compile java plugins. Compile and Install 1. The android app 'AIDE' - Download AIDE from PlayStore - Create a new AIDE project using the DroidScript SDK in the DS menu - Modify, Build, Install and Run the plugin app. A popup will appear once the plugin is ready to be installed on the next DroidScript restart 2. AndroidStudio - There is a UserPlugin template available on DroidScript's GitHub page - Follow the instructions in this BlogSpot guide It may be possible with other IDE's as well (ie. IntelliJ even has a AndroidSDK Plugin), but this has not been tested before or just couldn't be made to work. Communicate with your Java code In order to use the defined Java functions you have to call them from the JS part somehow. For this purpose DroidScript provides a _CreatePlugin component: var plg = _CreatePlugin( classpath, options ) plg.Destroy() plg.GetType() → string: “Plugin” plg.Send( name, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8 ) → string plg.SendObj( name, obj, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8 ) → string plg.CreateObj( type, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8 ) → string: “#id” plg.SendImg( name, img, width, height ) → string plg.SendCam( name, cam ) → string On the Java side following functions in public class MyPlugin { } will get called by DroidScript: public MyPlugin() public void Init( Context ctx, Object parent ) public void Release() public String CallPlugin( Bundle b ) public String CallPlugin( Bundle b, Object obj ) public Object CreateObject( Bundle b ) public void CallScript(Bundle b, String webViewId)
intro/CreatingGames.htm := Creating Games Back Creating Games JS Py Hello World Content: • Introduction • Overview: • GUI Games • Games with Images • Games with GLView • The GameView Introduction Something many coding beginners dream of is creating their own game. And not infrequently they think of a fancy 3D MMO shooter with eyecatching graphics, many levels, quests, characters and an exciting tears moving story on top of that. The reality looks a bit different but that's actually not a bad thing. Not that you'll be disappointed at the end: No DroidScript doesn't natively support 3D graphics yet. However it might not be far away. Let's be patient. Overview: For those who dislike reading I'll summarize some facts about the four ways you can create games in DroidScript: GUI Games: + Well suited for beginners + Easy animations using Tween.js + Intuitive style customization + Builtin touch, change etc. events for each element - Not suited for games with many animations and high framerate Image View: + Supports drawing of basic shapes, text (+ font loading) and image drawing + Good for simple games with more complex animations - Framerate drops quickly with increasing amount of drawing commands - basic shapes/text only: 20 draw commands → 30 fps - 6 0.3x0.2 images: ~20 fps (the smaller the drawn image the faster the drawing) GLView: + Very fast rendering + Supports drawing of subareas of a larger image (sprite sheets) - Only supports drawing images Game View: + Enormously fast rendering (See the Game BunnyStorm sample) + Many builtin game features: - Physics using Box2D - Sounds using JGAudio - SpriteSheets and SpriteSheet animations - Easy animations using Tween.js - Bitmap Fonts as game objects using angelcode xml format (visit BMFont Generator) + GL rendering and more with PIXI.js - basic shapes and polygons as game objects + Helper functions and main app access through the gfx object - Only works on Android 6 and newer GUI Games The by far easiest way to create games without complex maths and drawing commands is using GUI controls for your game. There will be few or even no animations at all. Instead the user can interact with the game like in a normal app. The following sample is a Tic Tac Toe implementation using button controls. It also demonstrates how UI controls can be animated using the Tween method. Example - Tic Tac Toe var btns = [], round = 1; var wh = app.GetDisplayWidth() / app.GetDisplayHeight(); //Called when app started. function OnStart() { app.SetOrientation( "Portrait" ); app.SetDebug( false ); lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); lay.SetBackColor( "#3355cc" ); txtPlayer = app.CreateText( "Player 1" ); txtPlayer.SetTextSize( 60, "pl" ); txtPlayer.SetMargins( 0, 0, 0, 0.1 ); lay.AddChild( txtPlayer ); //Create 3×3 Buttons for (var i = 0; i 3; i++) { var layH = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "Horizontal" ); lay.AddChild( layH ); for (var j = 0; j 3; j++) { var btn = app.CreateButton( "", 0.3, 0.3 * wh, "gray" ); btn.SetOnTouch( btn_OnTouch ); btn.SetTextSize( 60, "pl" ); layH.AddChild( btn ); btn.data.index = 3 * i + j; btns.push( btn ); } } app.AddLayout( lay ); } //Occupy button function btn_OnTouch() { var player = round % 2 + 1; if( this.GetText() != "" ) return; else this.SetText("XO"[player - 1]); this.Tween( { sw:-1, rot: 360 }, 200 ); lay.SetTouchable( false ); //Check winrows if someone won var winRows = [ "012", "345", "678", "036", "147", "258", "048", "642" ]; for(var i in winRows) { var row = ""; for(var j = 0; j 3; j++) row += btns[winRows[i][j]].GetText(); if(row == "XXX" || row == "OOO") return EndGame(player ); } //End game if no more free buttons exists if(++round == 9) return EndGame(0); txtPlayer.SetText( "Player " + player ); lay.SetTouchable( true ); } //Show results and reset function EndGame(player) { if( player ) app.Alert( "Player" + player + " won!", "Congratulations" ); else app.Alert( "It's a draw." ); // reset game setTimeout( function() { btns.forEach( function(btn) { btn.SetText(""); } ); lay.SetTouchable( true ); round = 0; }, 2000 ); } btns = [], round = 1 wh = app.GetDisplayWidth() / app.GetDisplayHeight() # Called when app started. def OnStart(): app.SetOrientation( "Portrait" ) app.SetDebug( false ) lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) lay.SetBackColor( "#3355cc" ) txtPlayer = app.CreateText( "Player 1" ) txtPlayer.SetTextSize( 60, "pl" ) txtPlayer.SetMargins( 0, 0, 0, 0.1 ) lay.AddChild( txtPlayer ) # Create 3×3 Buttons for i = 0; i 3; i++: layH = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "Horizontal" ) lay.AddChild( layH ) for j = 0; j 3; j++: btn = app.CreateButton( "", 0.3, 0.3 * wh, "gray" ) btn.SetOnTouch( btn_OnTouch ) btn.SetTextSize( 60, "pl" ) layH.AddChild( btn ) btn.data.index = 3 * i + j btns.push( btn ) app.AddLayout( lay ) # Occupy button def btn_OnTouch(): player = round % 2 + 1 if this.GetText() != "" : return else: this.SetText("XO"[player - 1]) this.Tween(sw:-1, rot: 360, 200 ) lay.SetTouchable( false ) # Check winrows if someone won winRows = [ "012", "345", "678", "036", "147", "258", "048", "642" ] for i in winRows: row = "" for j = 0; j 3; j++: row += btns[winRows[i][j]].GetText() if row == "XXX" || row == "OOO": return EndGame(player ) # End game if no more free buttons exists if ++round == 9: return EndGame(0) txtPlayer.SetText( "Player " + player ) lay.SetTouchable( true ) # Show results and reset def EndGame(player): if player : app.Alert( "Player" + player + " won!", "Congratulations" ) else: app.Alert( "It's a draw." ) # reset game setTimeout( function() btns.forEach( function(btn)btn.SetText("");) lay.SetTouchable( true ) round = 0;, 2000 ) Copy All Run Games with Images The most basic graphics container is the Image control. It also provides the most functionality for drawing like basic shapes, paint style and color, image drawing and even 2D matrix transformations. Despite the fact that the picture view is very powerful, it is not particularly fast. You should definitely use img.SetAutoUpdate(false); to be able to control when to update the canvas. By default you can achieve a maximum framerate of 60 fps, however the framerate decreases relatively fast the more draw commands you use. The following sample is a simple two-player Pong implementation using basic shapes only. It also demonstrates how you can handle multiple touches, and how a game can be made fps independent, so that collision detection on low fps is no problem any more. An advanced version is available on the dspk store. Example - Pong // User variables var x1 = 0.5, x2 = 0.5, p1 = 0, p2 = 0; // Called when app started. function OnStart() { app.SetOrientation( "Portrait" ); lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear" ); img = app.CreateImage( null, 1, 1 ); img.SetOnTouch( img_OnTouch ); img.SetAutoUpdate( false ); img.SetTextSize( 30 ); lay.AddChild( img ); Score(); app.AddLayout( lay ); app.Animate( OnAnimate, 50 ); } // Move user bar function img_OnTouch( ev ) { x2 = ev.X; } function crop( v, a, b ) { return v a ? a : v > b ? b : v; } // Calculate ball movement for a given deltatime var x, y, v = 0.5, dx = 0, dy = 0; function Calculate( dt ) { x += v * dx * dt / 1000; y += v * dy * dt / 1000; v += dt / 5e4; if( dy 0 y 0.5) x1 += crop( 10 * (x - x1), -2, 2 ) * dt / 1000; if( x 0.02 ) dx = Math.abs(dx); if( x > 0.98 ) dx = -Math.abs(dx); if( y > 0.04 y 0.05 x > x1 - 0.1 x x1 + 0.1 ) { dy = Math.abs( dy ); dx += 5 * ( x1 - x ); } if( y 0.96 y > 0.95 x > x2 - 0.1 x x2 + 0.1 ) { dy = -Math.abs( dy ); dx += 5 * ( x - x2 ); } if( y 0 ) Score( p2++ ); if( y > 1 ) Score( p1++ ); } // Core loop function OnAnimate( t, dt, nodraw ) { // Calculate positions in 4 milliseconds steps do { Calculate(4); dt -= 4; } while( dt > 0 ); // Render state img.Clear(); img.DrawCircle( x, y, 0.02 ); img.DrawText( p1, 0.05, 0.4 ); img.DrawText( p2, 0.05, 0.6 ); img.DrawRectangle( x1 - 0.1, 0.03, x1 + 0.1, 0.04 ); img.DrawRectangle( x2 - 0.1, 0.96, x2 + 0.1, 0.97 ); img.Update(); } // Reset after score function Score() { x = 0.5; dx = 0; y = 0.5; dy = 0; v = 0.5; var PI = Math.PI; setTimeout( function() { var a = Math.random() * PI; if( a > PI/2 ) a += PI/2; dx = Math.cos( a + PI/4 ); dy = Math.sin( a + PI/4 ); }, 1000 ); } # User variables x1 = 0.5, x2 = 0.5, p1 = 0, p2 = 0 # Called when app started. def OnStart(): app.SetOrientation( "Portrait" ) lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear" ) img = app.CreateImage( null, 1, 1 ) img.SetOnTouch( img_OnTouch ) img.SetAutoUpdate( false ) img.SetTextSize( 30 ) lay.AddChild( img ) Score() app.AddLayout( lay ) app.Animate( OnAnimate, 50 ) # Move user bar def img_OnTouch( ev ): x2 = ev.X def crop( v, a, b ): return v a ? a : v > b ? b : v # Calculate ball movement for a given deltatime x, y, v = 0.5, dx = 0, dy = 0 def Calculate( dt ): x += v * dx * dt / 1000 y += v * dy * dt / 1000 v += dt / 5e4 if dy 0 y 0.5: x1 += crop( 10 * (x - x1), -2, 2 ) * dt / 1000 if x 0.02 : dx = Math.abs(dx) if x > 0.98 : dx = -Math.abs(dx) if y > 0.04 y 0.05 x > x1 - 0.1 x x1 + 0.1 : dy = Math.abs( dy ) dx += 5 * ( x1 - x ) if y 0.96 y > 0.95 x > x2 - 0.1 x x2 + 0.1 : dy = -Math.abs( dy ) dx += 5 * ( x - x2 ) if y 0 : Score( p2++ ) if y > 1 : Score( p1++ ) # Core loop def OnAnimate( t, dt, nodraw ): # Calculate positions in 4 milliseconds steps doCalculate(4); dt -= 4 while dt > 0 : # Render state img.Clear() img.DrawCircle( x, y, 0.02 ) img.DrawText( p1, 0.05, 0.4 ) img.DrawText( p2, 0.05, 0.6 ) img.DrawRectangle( x1 - 0.1, 0.03, x1 + 0.1, 0.04 ) img.DrawRectangle( x2 - 0.1, 0.96, x2 + 0.1, 0.97 ) img.Update() # Reset after score def Score(): x = 0.5; dx = 0 y = 0.5; dy = 0 v = 0.5 PI = Math.PI setTimeout( function() a = Math.random() * PI if a > PI/2 : a += PI/2 dx = Math.cos( a + PI/4 ) dy = Math.sin( a + PI/4 );, 1000 ) Copy All Run Games with GLView The third option you have is the so called GLView which is based on the FastCanvas Plugin The GLView has 2 unique properties: - Your application runs a full screen canvas - Use of the 2D canvas API is limited to transforms and drawing images (see: FastCanvas API) That does not mean the GLView is bad. The GLView can render an enormous amount of sprites on a acceptable framerate. (Ie. on my device 500 rendered sprites produced a framerate of about 45 fps). This makes it perfect for games using images and sprite sheets only. Additionally the GameView will also run on older devices unlike the last graphic container you'll experience now.

It is STRONGLY recomended that you backup this file. You cannot update your app released using this key on Google Play or on any other device, unless you have the original file (and can also remember the password!) build.json If you create a file called 'build.json' at the top level of your project, then you will be able to control certain aspects of the APK build process, such as the 'minSdkVersion' setting in the manifest, which sets the minimum version of Android that your app will run on. Example - build.json { "manifest": { "minSdkVersion": 23, "targetSdkVersion": 28, "debuggable": false, "removePermissions": "WRITE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE", "homeScreen": false, "noPermsAction": "default", "pathPattern": ".*\.png,.*\.jpg" }, "autoPermissions": true } "manifest": "minSdkVersion": 23, "targetSdkVersion": 28, "debuggable": false, "removePermissions": "WRITE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE", "homeScreen": false, "noPermsAction": "default", "pathPattern": ".*\.png,.*\.jpg", "autoPermissions": true Copy All Run Note: This file is optional and not required for building APKs If you release your app on Google Play, the 'minSdkVersion' setting will control whether people with older phones can see your app in the store. If your app does not perform well on older versions of Android, then it is usually a good idea to make it unavailable for older phones or you will get lots of negative ratings and people will avoid your app. There may also be features such as Bluetooth 4.0 which are unavailable on older versions of Android. DroidScript uses a simplified permissions model and scans your code looking for the required Android permissions, but you may want more fine-grain control of these permissions, so the 'removePermissions' setting allows you to explicitly remove Android permissions from your APK. See the Android SDK docs for for a full list of permissions. The 'homeScreen' setting is only used for creating home screen launchers apps, public kiosks and machine control type apps which totally take over the Android device, so don't use this option unless you know what you are doing! If you want your app to handle certain types of file when the user tries to open them or use the 'Share via' option, then the 'pathPattern' setting allows you to specify which file types your app accepts. For example, if you were writing a text editor, then you would use the *\\.txt pattern. See the 'Shared Data' and 'Receive Intent' samples in DroidScript for demos of how to handle file and text in your app. The 'debuggable' setting is intended for advanced users and allows your installed app to be debugged via the Android Debug Bridge. This setting defaults to false and should never be set to true in public releases of your app. Example - minimal build.json { "manifest": { "minSdkVersion": 23, "targetSdkVersion": 28 } } "manifest": "minSdkVersion": 23, "targetSdkVersion": 28 Copy All Run Internal Files Here is a selection of the most common used internal DroidScript assets, that are available in DroidScript and when enabling 'Include Assets' in the APK Builder. /Sys/Img/ AScript.png Add.png Banner.png BarA.png Bird_960x687x3x3.png BlackBack.jpg BlueBack.jpg Bulb.png Bunny.png Color.png Connect.png Droid1.png Droid2.png Eagle1.png Eagle2.png Exit.png Explode1.png Explode2.png Explode3.png Explode4.png Explode5.png Files.png Forward.png GreenBack.jpg Hello.png Icon.png JoyPad.png Layout.png Left.png Light.png Mic.png Notify.png NxtConn.png Offline.png Pillar.png PillarTop.png Play.png Question.png Refresh.png Reverse.png Right.png Settings.png Sky.jpg Sound.png Splash.gif Splat.png Spring.png Sprint.png StarField.jpg Tab.png TabHi.png TabHi_.png Tab_.png Tile.png Touch.png Ultra.png VBarA.png VBarB.png VBarC.png Xylophone.png bar_dark.png desyrel.png desyrel.xml ioio.png /Sys/Snd/ Bullet.mp3 Explode.mp3 Poing.ogg Squeak.mp3 Trill.ogg Other: /Sys/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.ttf /Sys/Html/Page.htm /Sys/Html/Template.htm /Sys/images/android-logo-mask.png /Sys/images/android-logo-shine.png /Sys/images/clock_font.png Drawable Resources: These are not regular files but xml-based "drawable resources" provided by Android in the resources.arsc file.

intro/BestPractices.htm := Best Practices Back Best Practices JS Py Hello World Content: • General • Performance - UI - Graphics / Animations • Getting Help General - Use the cfg object to enter specific app modes immediately (See CodingFeatures for more details) - Use app.Script to load extra source files - Use app.Add* eqivalents to app.Create* to make your code shorter and cleaner - Use features that DS provides you instead of doing them yourself (ie. filtering ListFolder items) - Frequently check the debug log for any warnings or errors - especially before releasing your app (see CreateDebug) - Use the web IDE for coding if you have a laptop because it is much easier than typing and debugging on a phone Performance UI - Wrap your UI creation in app.Hide and app.Show - Use cfg.Dark and cfg.Light for an easy Light/Dark theme setting - Use obj.Batch to do a whole bunch of configuration calls at one shot - Add a (optionally animated) splash screen while your app loads UI - Use app.SetDebug(false) in your release version - Reduce the use of app.* calls (especially in loops) as it calls the backend bridge in most cases - Use lay.SetChildMargins and lay.SetChildTextSize to apply these properties to all children - When initializing list controls use a precompiled item list instead of calling AddItem multiple times - Apply styling to buttons and text boxes using the “Html” option - Use the premium app.CreateTheme method for styling controls Graphics / Animations - Use app.Animate instead of setInterval - Use img.SetAutoUpdate(false) and use manual img.Update calls - Switch to the CreateGameView control (using cfg.Game) as its generally faster and works in web browsers too - use the “async” option to load images Getting Help - Check out this documentation and the DS Wiki for any hints - Check if your issue has been resolved before by searching keywords on Google and on the OfficialForums - For short questions check out the Chat extension in the mobile or WiFi IDE - For more complex questions formalize your issue in the OfficialForums - Always be polite, respectful and never offend any person or group of people - Describe your issue in a way people can understand it without knowing anything about your individual project - Attach screenshots and demo SPKs to your question - Consider putting together a minimal demo showcasing your issue Example -

Default Apps Example - Default Apps var categories = [ "android.intent.category.APP_BROWSER", // browser "android.intent.category.APP_MUSIC", // music "android.intent.category.APP_CALCULATOR", // calculator "android.intent.category.APP_CONTACTS", // contacts "android.intent.category.APP_EMAIL", // email "android.intent.category.APP_MAPS", // maps "android.intent.category.APP_GALLERY", // gallery "android.intent.category.APP_CALENDAR", // calendar "android.intent.category.APP_MARKET", // market "android.intent.category.APP_MESSAGING", // messaging ]; app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.intent.action.MAIN", categories[0]); categories = [ "android.intent.category.APP_BROWSER", # browser "android.intent.category.APP_MUSIC", # music "android.intent.category.APP_CALCULATOR", # calculator "android.intent.category.APP_CONTACTS", # contacts "android.intent.category.APP_EMAIL", # email "android.intent.category.APP_MAPS", # maps "android.intent.category.APP_GALLERY", # gallery "android.intent.category.APP_CALENDAR", # calendar "android.intent.category.APP_MARKET", # market "android.intent.category.APP_MESSAGING", # messaging ] app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.intent.action.MAIN", categories[0]) Copy All Run URI Intents Playstore App Page var packageName = "com.skype.raider"; app.OpenUrl("market:details?id=" + packageName); Skype: URI documentation app.OpenUrl("skype:echo123?call"); Standard Apps GMail Example - Create Email in GMail App var packageName = "com.google.android.gm"; var className = "com.google.android.gm.ComposeActivityGmail"; var action = "android.intent.action.VIEW"; var category = null; var uri = "myfriend@gmail.com"; var type = "message/rfc822"; var extras = JSON.stringify([ { name: "android.intent.extra.EMAIL", type: "list", value: "fred@gmail.com" }, { name: "android.intent.extra.SUBJECT", type: "string", value: "My subject" }, { name: "android.intent.extra.TEXT", type: "string", value: "Hello!" } ]); app.SendIntent(packageName, className, action, category, uri, type, extras); packageName = "com.google.android.gm" className = "com.google.android.gm.ComposeActivityGmail" action = "android.intent.action.VIEW" category = null uri = "myfriend@gmail.com" type = "message/rfc822" extras = JSON.stringify([name: "android.intent.extra.EMAIL", type: "list", value: "fred@gmail.com",name: "android.intent.extra.SUBJECT", type: "string", value: "My subject",name: "android.intent.extra.TEXT", type: "string", value: "Hello!" ]) app.SendIntent(packageName, className, action, category, uri, type, extras) Copy All Run Google Maps Google Maps intent documentation Example - Basic Maps function OnStart() { var lat = "51.5117"; var lng = "-0.1275"; simpleMap(lat, lng); } function simpleMap(latitude, longitude) { var packageName = "com.google.android.apps.maps"; var className = null; var action = "android.intent.action.VIEW"; var uri = "geo:" + latitude + "," + longitude; app.SendIntent(packageName, className, action, null, uri); } def OnStart(): lat = "51.5117" lng = "-0.1275" simpleMap(lat, lng) def simpleMap(latitude, longitude): packageName = "com.google.android.apps.maps" className = null action = "android.intent.action.VIEW" uri = "geo:" + latitude + "," + longitude app.SendIntent(packageName, className, action, null, uri) Copy All Run Example - Maps Turn by Turn Navigation function navigateTo(latitude, longitude) { var packageName = "com.google.android.apps.maps"; var className = null; var action = "android.intent.action.VIEW"; var uri = "google.navigation:q=" + latitude + "," + longitude; if (app.IsAppInstalled(packageName)) app.SendIntent(packageName, className, action, null, uri); else app.Alert("maps app not installed"); } def navigateTo(latitude, longitude): packageName = "com.google.android.apps.maps" className = null action = "android.intent.action.VIEW" uri = "google.navigation:q=" + latitude + "," + longitude if app.IsAppInstalled(packageName): app.SendIntent(packageName, className, action, null, uri) else: app.Alert("maps app not installed") Copy All Run Example - Maps Location app.SendIntent( "com.google.android.apps.maps", null, "android.intent.action.VIEW", "android.intent.category.DEFAULT", "geo:0,0?q=34.5678,123.4567 (Placename)" // uri argument ); app.SendIntent( "com.google.android.apps.maps", null, "android.intent.action.VIEW", "android.intent.category.DEFAULT", "geo:0,0?q=34.5678,123.4567 (Placename)" # uri argument ) Copy All Run Phone Calls Note: package and activity are not required because the dialer app differs among manufacturers and sometimes event among models from same manufacturer. Example - Phone Call /* Some devices may display the Dialer app for both `DIAL` and `CALL`. * `CALL` requires `PHONE` permission and `DIAL` does not * `DIAL` does not allow emergency calls * `DIAL` suppresses some special characters such as # to prevent abuse */ // Launch Dialer app app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.intent.action.DIAL", null, "tel colon;5551237654"); // Direct Call app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.intent.action.CALL", null, "tel colon;5551237654"); /* Some devices may display the Dialer app for both `DIAL` and `CALL`. * `CALL` requires `PHONE` permission and `DIAL` does not * `DIAL` does not allow emergency calls * `DIAL` suppresses some special characters such as # to prevent abuse */ # Launch Dialer app app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.intent.action.DIAL", null, "tel colon;5551237654") # Direct Call app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.intent.action.CALL", null, "tel colon;5551237654") Copy All Run SMS Example - Basic SMS var number = "0123456789"; var message = "my message"; app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.intent.action.SENDTO", null, 'smsto:' + number, null, JSON.stringify([{ name: "sms_body", type: "string", value: message }])); number = "0123456789" message = "my message" app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.intent.action.SENDTO", null, 'smsto:' + number, null, JSON.stringify([ name: "sms_body", type: "string", value: message])) Copy All Run Camera Example - Camera Modes // Launch a camera in still image mode. app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA"); // Launch secure photo mode without attaching personal info // previous snaps/videos, gallery, etc. link won't work // used when device is secured (pin, password, etc), recommended use in locker apps. app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA_SECURE"); // Launch a camera in video recording mode. app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.media.action.VIDEO_CAMERA"); # Launch a camera in still image mode. app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA") # Launch secure photo mode without attaching personal info # previous snaps/videos, gallery, etc. link won't work # used when device is secured (pin, password, etc), recommended use in locker apps. app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA_SECURE") # Launch a camera in video recording mode. app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.media.action.VIDEO_CAMERA") Copy All Run Settings The Settings Intent Documentation has a Constants section with available Actions. Replace ACTION_ by android.settings. to get the category parameter. Example - Settings // Bluetooth app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.settings.BLUETOOTH_SETTINGS" ) // WiFi app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.settings.WIFI_SETTINGS" ) # Bluetooth app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.settings.BLUETOOTH_SETTINGS" ) # WiFi app.SendIntent(null, null, "android.settings.WIFI_SETTINGS" ) Copy All Run Misc Example - Add Calendar Event function cal_si_insert() { var today = Date.now();

app/CreateDialog.htm := CreateDialog Back CreateDialog JS Py Hello World Content: - Methods Custom dialogs appear on top of the app and thus can be used to show temporary information or collect data from the user. They are also useful for displaying configuration or settings controls. dlg = app.CreateDialog( title, options ) → app object: Dialog Dialogs are resizeable and you can also change the look of them so that they fit in with the theme of your application. A custom dialog needs a layout to add the controls to. Use the CreateLayout method of the app object to add a layout. layDlg = app.CreateLayout( type, options ); dlg.AddLayout( layDlg ); If you have added all your controls to the dialog layout you can use the Show method to show the dialog. Normally the user can cancel the dialog by pressing the BACK button of the device, but you can disable that option by using the “NoCancel” option. In order to close the dialog now, you have to call Dismiss. Example - Demo function OnStart() { dlg = app.CreateDialog( "Custom Dialog" ); layDlg = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); layDlg.SetSize( 0.7, 0.3 ); dlg.AddLayout( layDlg ); chk = app.CreateCheckBox( "Check Box" ); chk.SetMargins( 0, 0.02, 0, 0.02 ); layDlg.AddChild( chk ); btnDlg = app.CreateButton( "Close Dialog", 0.6, 0.1 ); btnDlg.SetOnTouch( btnDlg_OnTouch ); layDlg.AddChild( btnDlg ); dlg.Show(); } function btnDlg_OnTouch() { dlg.Dismiss(); } from native import app def OnStart(): global dlg dlg = app.CreateDialog( "Custom Dialog" ) layDlg = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) layDlg.SetSize( 0.7, 0.3 ) dlg.AddLayout( layDlg ) chk = app.CreateCheckBox( "Check Box" ) chk.SetMargins( 0, 0.02, 0, 0.02 ) layDlg.AddChild( chk ) btnDlg = app.CreateButton( "Close Dialog", 0.6, 0.1 ) btnDlg.SetOnTouch( btnDlg_OnTouch ) layDlg.AddChild( btnDlg ) dlg.Show() def btnDlg_OnTouch(): dlg.Dismiss() Copy All Run Methods The following methods are available on the Dialog object: AddLayout( layout ) AdjustColor( hue, saturation, brightness, contrast ) Batch( properties ) ClearFocus() Dismiss() EnableBackKey( enable ) Focus() GetAbsHeight() → Number: integer GetAbsWidth() → Number: integer GetHeight( options ) → Number GetLeft( options ) → Number GetParent() → app object GetPosition( options ) → Object: { left, top, width, height } GetTitleHeight() → Number: pixel GetTop( options ) → Number GetType() → String: “Dialog” GetVisibility() → String: “Show” or “Hide” or “Gone” GetWidth( options ) → Number Gone() Hide() IsEnabled() → Boolean IsOverlap( obj, depth ) → Boolean IsVisible() → Boolean Method( name, types, p1, p2, p3, p4 ) → all types RemoveLayout( layout ) Resize() SetBackAlpha( alpha ) SetBackColor( color, radius ) SetBackGradient( color1, color2, color3, options ) SetBackGradientRadial( x, y, radius, color1, color2, color3, options ) SetBackground( file, options ) SetColorFilter( color, mode ) SetDescription( desc ) SetEnabled( enable ) SetMargins( left, top, right, bottom, mode ) SetOnBack( callback ) SetOnCancel( callback ) SetOnTouch( callback ) SetPadding( left, top, right, bottom, mode ) SetPosition( left, top, width, height, options ) SetScale( x, y ) SetSize( width, height, options ) SetTitle( title ) SetTitleColor( clr ) SetTitleDividerColor( color ) SetTitleDividerHeight( height, options ) SetTitleHeight( height, options ) SetTitleTextSize( size, options ) SetVisibility( mode ) Show() Tween( target, duration, type, repeat, yoyo, callback ) function( event )

app/CreateGame.htm := CreateGame Back CreateGame JS Py Hello World Content: - Methods CreateGame automatically turns your app in game mode and adds a GameView control to it which loads the referenced script. gam = app.CreateGame( file, orient ) It also applies various settings to your app such like orientation, ScreenMode(“Game”) and PreventScreenLock(true). You can still access the GameView and the layout where it was added to via gam.game and gam.lay Note: If you want to have more control over the GameView control use CreateGameView directly. You can also put the cfg.Game flag at the top level of your script to write the game code immediately in your main script. Example - Game_Bounce.js //Configure app for landscape game mode. cfg.Game, cfg.Portrait //Called when game starts, so we can load our assets. function OnLoad() { //Enable physics with gravity of 20. gfx.AddPhysics( 20 ) //Enclose screen with invisible walls. gfx.Enclose( -1, "left,right" ) //Create our sprite images. sky = gfx.CreateBackground( "/Sys/Img/Sky.jpg", "stretch" ) bunny = gfx.CreateSprite( "/Sys/Img/Bunny.png", "bunnies" ) floor = gfx.CreateRectangle( 1, 0.05, 0x338833, 0,0,1, "floor" ) } //Called when game assets have loaded. function OnReady() { //Add background. gfx.AddBackground( sky ) //Add floor. gfx.AddGraphic( floor, 0, 0.95 ) floor.SetPhysics( 2, "fixed", 0.9, 0.8, 0.1 ) //Add character and set physics properties. //(groupId, type, density, bounce, friction) gfx.AddSprite( bunny, 0.2, 0.2, 0.05 ) bunny.SetPhysics( 1, "Dynamic", 0.5, 0.9, 0.1 ) bunny.SetVelocity( 0.7, 0 ) //Start game. gfx.Play() } # cfg.Game, cfg.Portrait # Configure app for landscape game mode. # Called when game starts, so we can load our assets. def OnLoad(): global sky, bunny, floor # Enable physics with gravity of 20. gfx.AddPhysics(20) # Enclose screen with invisible walls. gfx.Enclose(-1, "left,right") # Create our sprite images. sky = gfx.CreateBackground("/Sys/Img/Sky.jpg", "stretch") bunny = gfx.CreateSprite("/Sys/Img/Bunny.png", "bunnies") floor = gfx.CreateRectangle(1, 0.05, 0x338833, 0, 0, 1, "floor") # Called when game assets have loaded. def OnReady(): # Add background. gfx.AddBackground(sky) # Add floor. gfx.AddGraphic(floor, 0, 0.95) floor.SetPhysics(2, "fixed", 0.9, 0.8, 0.1) # Add character and set physics properties. # (groupId, type, density, bounce, friction) gfx.AddSprite(bunny, 0.2, 0.2, 0.05) bunny.SetPhysics(1, "Dynamic", 0.5, 0.9, 0.1) bunny.SetVelocity(0.7, 0) # Start game. gfx.Play() Copy All Run Example - Demo function OnStart() { app.CopyFile("/assets/samples/Game_Bounce.js", "script.js"); app.CreateGame("script.js", "landscape"); } from native import app def OnStart(): app.CopyFile("/assets/samples/Game_Bounce.js", "script.js") app.CreateGame("script.js", "landscape") Copy All Run Methods The following methods are available on the Game object: game → app object: Game lay → app object: Layout
app/CreateGameView.htm := CreateGameView Back CreateGameView JS Py Hello World Content: - GameView in web browsers - Methods The GameView is a blindingly fast container for game development with a physics engine and PIXI as underlying sprite container which uses the GPU to render graphics. gmv = app.CreateGameView( width, height, options ) The GameView runs a standalone script which can communicate with the main app via gfx.Execute or gmv.Execute vice versa. Starting from DS 2.05 the GameView supports the same options as CreateGame. You can find references of GameView scripting here: - official DS GameView tutorials (Start with lesson 1; Sample SPK) GameView in web browsers If you prefer to work on a PC you can even run and debug your GameView code in a regular web-browser.

app/CreateGLView.htm := CreateGLView Back CreateGLView JS Py Hello World Content: - Render Loop - Sprite Touch Detection - Sprite Animations - Methods GLView is a fast 2D canvas suitable for drawing and moving graphics around on the screen quickly, ideal for games. The options parameter should be always set to “Fast2d”. glv = app.CreateGLView( width, height, options ) → app object: GLView Use the CreateImage method of the GLView object to create an image that can be used with the GLView. You can specity a callback function too which will be called once the image is ready to use. To draw the sprite on the canvas use the DrawImage method. Note: don't forget to specify all parameters, including angle. Otherwise the image will not be drawn. You can leave either width or height -1 to scale the other parameter according to the sprite aspect ratio. Once all drawing has been done, the Render method must be called to render all the GLView graphics to the screen. Example - DrawImage function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "FillXY" ); glview = app.CreateGLView( 1, 1, "Fast2d" ); lay.AddChild( glview ); img = glview.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Hello.png", DrawFrame ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function DrawFrame() { glview.DrawImage( img, 0.25, 0.3, 0.5, -1, 45 ); glview.Render(); } from native import app def OnStart(): global glview, img lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "FillXY" ) glview = app.CreateGLView(1, 1, "Fast2d") lay.AddChild(glview) img = glview.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Hello.png", DrawFrame ) app.AddLayout(lay) def DrawFrame(): glview.DrawImage( img, 0.25, 0.3, 0.5, -1, 45 ) glview.Render() Copy Copy All Run Render Loop To create a rendering loop for a game, use the setInterval JavaScript function to call your drawing function at regular intervals. The example below draws a continuously rotating image by calling the DrawFrame function 30 times each second, updating the angle each time: Example - Render Loop var angle = 0; function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "FillXY" ); glview = app.CreateGLView( 1, 1, "Fast2d" ); lay.AddChild( glview ); img = glview.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Hello.png", StartRendering ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function StartRendering() { setInterval( DrawFrame, 1000/30 ); } function DrawFrame() { glview.DrawImage( img, 0.25, 0.3, 0.5, -1, angle ); angle = angle + 10; if( angle == 360 ) angle = 0; glview.Render(); } from native import app angle = 0 def OnStart(): global glview, img lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "FillXY" ) glview = app.CreateGLView(1, 1, "Fast2d") lay.AddChild(glview) img = glview.CreateImage("/Sys/Img/Hello.png", StartRendering) app.AddLayout(lay) def StartRendering(): app.SetInterval(DrawFrame, 1000/30 ) def DrawFrame(): glview.DrawImage( img, 0.25, 0.3, 0.5, -1, angle ) angle = angle + 10 if( angle == 360 ) angle = 0 glview.Render() Copy Copy All Run Sprite Touch Detection If you need to want to simulate OnTouch for a GLView Image, you will need to keep track of the position, width and height that it has been drawn with. Then use the GLView OnTouch event to determine if the touch coordinates are within the GLView Image yourself. To prevent touch detect on all sprites on the touch position define a drawing order according to a list.

The DrawSprite method can be used to draw part of an image to the GLView. The following example uses a sprite sheet containing 8 stages of a character running. The DrawSprite method is used to draw each of the 8 sections in turn to give the effect of the character continuously running: Example - Sprite Sheet Animation var spriteCount = 8; var srcWidth = 50; var srcHeight = 60; var frameCount = 0; function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "FillXY" ); glview = app.CreateGLView( 1, 1, "Fast2d" ); lay.AddChild( glview ); img = glview.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Sprint.png", StartRendering ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function StartRendering() { setInterval(DrawFrame, 1000/30); } function DrawFrame() { var spriteIndex = Math.floor(frameCount / 2) % spriteCount; var sx = spriteIndex * srcWidth; var sy = 0; glview.DrawSprite( img, sx, sy, srcWidth, srcHeight, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, -1 ); glview.Render(); frameCount++; } from native import app spriteCount = 8 srcWidth = 50 srcHeight = 60 frameCount = 0 def OnStart(): global glview, img lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "FillXY" ) glview = app.CreateGLView(1, 1, "Fast2d") lay.AddChild(glview) img = glview.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Sprint.png", StartRendering ) app.AddLayout(lay) def StartRendering(): app.SetInterval( DrawFrame, 1000/30 ) def DrawFrame(): spriteIndex = app.MathFloor(frameCount / 2) % spriteCount sx = spriteIndex * srcWidth sy = 0 glview.DrawSprite( img, sx, sy, srcWidth, srcHeight, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, -1 ) glview.Render() frameCount += 1 Copy Copy All Run Methods The following methods are available on the GLView object: aspect → Number: float Batch( properties ) canvas → Object ClearFocus() CreateImage( file, callback ) → Object: img CreateImage.img.height → Number: integer CreateImage.img.width → Number: integer DrawImage( image, x, y, w, h, angle ) DrawSprite( sheet, sx, sy, sw, sh, dx, dy, dw, dh, angle ) Focus() GetAbsHeight() → Number: integer GetAbsWidth() → Number: integer GetContext() → Object: ctx GetContext.ctx.capture( x, y, w, h, fileName, successCallback, errorCallback ) GetContext.ctx.clearRect( x, y, width, height ) GetContext.ctx.drawImage( image, sx, sy, sw, sh, dx, dy, dw, dh ) GetContext.ctx.render() GetContext.ctx.resetTransform() GetContext.ctx.restore() GetContext.ctx.rotate( angle ) GetContext.ctx.save() GetContext.ctx.scale( a, d ) GetContext.ctx.setTransform( a, b, c, d, tx, ty ) GetContext.ctx.transform( a, b, c, d, tx, ty ) GetContext.ctx.translate( tx, ty ) GetHeight( options ) → Number GetLeft( options ) → Number GetParent() → app object GetPosition( options ) → Object: { left, top, width, height } GetTop( options ) → Number GetType() → String: “GLView” GetVisibility() → String: “Show” or “Hide” or “Gone” GetWidth( options ) → Number Gone() height → Number: integer Hide() IsEnabled() → Boolean IsOverlap( obj, depth ) → Boolean IsVisible() → Boolean Method( name, types, p1, p2, p3, p4 ) → all types Render() SetBackColor( color ) SetBackGradient( color1, color2, color3, options ) SetBackGradientRadial( x, y, radius, color1, color2, color3, options ) SetBackground( file, options ) SetDescription( desc ) SetEnabled( enable ) SetMargins( left, top, right, bottom, mode ) SetOnTouch( callback ) SetOnTouchDown( callback ) SetOnTouchMove( callback ) SetOnTouchUp( callback ) SetPadding( left, top, right, bottom, mode ) SetPosition( left, top, width, height, options ) SetScale( x, y ) SetSize( width, height, options ) SetTouchable( touchable ) SetVisibility( mode ) Show() Tween( target, duration, type, repeat, yoyo, callback ) width → Number: integer function( event ) function( event ) function( event ) function( event )
app/CreateImage.htm := CreateImage Back CreateImage JS Py Hello World Content: - Drawing on Images - Drawing on Images fast - Methods Image controls can be used to display images such like png, jpg or gif. Just pass the file path and you're done. img = app.CreateImage( file, width, height, options, pxw, pxh ) → app object: Image Without the width and height dimensions the image will be shown without any scaling. Example - Original Size function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); img = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Droid1.png" ); img.SetOnTouch( img_OnTouch ); lay.AddChild( img ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function img_OnTouch( ev ) { if( ev.action=="Down" ) app.ShowPopup( "Ouch!" ); } from native import app def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) img = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Droid1.png" ) img.SetOnTouch( img_OnTouch ) lay.AddChild( img ) app.AddLayout( lay ) def img_OnTouch( ev ): if ev.action=="Down": app.ShowPopup( "Ouch!" ) Copy Copy All Run If you specify one of them and leave the other null, -1 or blank, it will be scaled so that the aspect ratio is kept. Example - Maintain Aspect function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); img = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Droid1.png", 0.5, -1 ); img.SetOnTouch( img_OnTouch ); lay.AddChild( img ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function img_OnTouch( ev ) { if( ev.action=="Down" ) app.ShowPopup( ev.x[0] + ", " + ev.y[0], "Short" ); } from native import app def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) img = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Droid1.png", 0.5, -1 ) img.SetOnTouch( img_OnTouch ) lay.AddChild( img ) app.AddLayout( lay ) def img_OnTouch( ev ): if ev.action=="Down": app.ShowPopup( ev.x[0] + ", " + ev.y[0], "Short" ) Copy Copy All Run And if you specify both parameters it will be scaled to your wishes. Example - Stretched function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); img = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Droid1.png", 0.5, 0.7 ); img.SetOnTouch( img_OnTouch ); lay.AddChild( img ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function img_OnTouch( ev ) { if( ev.action=="Down" ) app.ShowPopup( "Aaaargh!" ); } from native import app def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) img = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Droid1.png", 0.5, 0.7 ) img.SetOnTouch( img_OnTouch ) lay.AddChild( img ) app.AddLayout( lay ) def img_OnTouch( ev ): if ev.action=="Down": app.ShowPopup( "Aaaargh!" ) Copy Copy All Run If you want images to depress like buttons if touched you can use the “Button” option. Example - Button function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); btn = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Hello.png", 0.2, -1, "button" ); btn.SetOnTouchUp( btn_OnTouch ); lay.AddChild( btn ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function btn_OnTouch() { app.ShowPopup( "Hello World!" ); app.Vibrate( "0,100,30,100,50,300" ); } from native import app def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) btn = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Hello.png", 0.2, -1, "button" ) btn.SetOnTouchUp( btn_OnTouch ) lay.AddChild( btn ) app.AddLayout( lay ) def btn_OnTouch(event): app.ShowPopup( "Hello World!" ) app.Vibrate( "0,100,30,100,50,300" ) Copy All Run Drawing on Images Images are also useful for drawing basic shapes and other images on it and therefore for creating dynamic animations or even basic games. To create an empty image you can pass null as file parameter. This way you can also specify a fixed pixel size to the image you can use the “fix” option and pass values for the pxw and pxh parameters. img = app.CreateImage( null, 0.8, 0.5, "fix", 20, 20 ); img.DrawLine( 0, 0, 1, 1 ); If you dislike the anti-alias effect you can apply the “alias” option on a higher resolution image and draw a low-resolution image on it: img2 = app.CreateImage( null, .8, .5, "alias" ); img2.DrawImage( img, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0 ); There are a whole bunch of drawing methods defined here. Some of the were already used above. You can draw lines, rectangles, circles and other images, just to name a few. You can even draw a transformed image using an transformation matrix. Check out the Draw* methods in the method list below to get more details about all drawing functions. Example - Draw Shapes function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); img = app.CreateImage( null, 0.8, 0.8 ); lay.AddChild( img ); img.SetColor( "#8888ff" ); img.SetPaintColor( "#ff0000" ); img.DrawCircle( 0.5, 0.5, 0.1 ); img.DrawRectangle( 0.7, 0.7, 0.1, 0.75 ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } from native import app def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) img = app.CreateImage( None, 0.8, 0.8 ) lay.AddChild( img ) img.SetColor( "#8888ff" ) img.SetPaintColor( "#ff0000" ) img.DrawCircle( 0.5, 0.5, 0.1 ) img.DrawRectangle( 0.7, 0.7, 0.1, 0.75 ) app.AddLayout( lay ) Copy Copy All Run Drawing on Images fast If you have many draw operations to perform at runtime (ie. for games) you might want to disable the automatic canvas update after each Draw* call using the SetAutoUpdate method. To force the rendering now, you have to call Update. Another way to increase the animation speed is using the NoDom configuration. This will disable html and js Dom elements in your app that consume a lot of resources, but app functions can still be used. For animations you can then use the Animate function of the app object which calls a function for a given amount per second. Note that the canvas still needs some time to refresh - so going over 60 fps makes no sense at all. Example - Advanced Clock Animating cfg.No_Dom, cfg.Portrait; var wh; function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); // clock pointer ptr = app.CreateImage( null, 0.1, 0.1, "fix,alias", 30, 30 ); ptr.SetTextSize( 4.3 ); // image aspect ratio for drawing square images wh = ptr.GetAbsWidth() / ptr.GetAbsHeight(); // main canvas img = app.CreateImage( null, 1, 1, "alias" ); img.SetPaintStyle( "line" ); img.SetAutoUpdate( false ); img.SetLineWidth( 15 ); lay.AddChild( img ); app.AddLayout( lay ); app.SetDebug( "console" ); app.Animate( OnAnimate, 40 ); } function OnAnimate( time, dtime ) { time = Date.now(); // calculate pointer position from current time var secs = time / 1000; var angle = Math.PI * secs / 2 + Math.abs( Math.sin( Math.PI * secs )); var px = 0.5 + 0.5 * Math.cos( angle ); var py = 0.5 + 0.5 * Math.sin( angle );

app/CreateLayout.htm := CreateLayout Back CreateLayout JS Py Hello World Content: - Linear Layouts - Frame Layouts - Absolute Layouts - Card Layouts - Methods Layouts are container objects which are used to visually organize graphical objects (controls), such as text, buttons and images on the screen. lay = app.CreateLayout( type, options ) → app object: Layout There are 4 types of layouts: “Linear”, “Absolute”, “Frame” and “Card”. Layouts are transparent by default but you can set a background image which can be tiled or stretched to fill the layout. You can also set a background color or background gradient. You can add child objects to the Layout using the AddChild function: lay.AddChild( object ); The alignment of chlld objects within a layout can be set by adding the options “Left”, “Right”, “Bottom” and “VCenter”, by default objects will be aligned “Top,Center”. Linear Layouts Linear layouts are probably the most useful type and are used to organize controls in either the default “Vertical” or “Horizontal” direction on screen. Example - Vertical function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "Vertical" ); btnA = app.CreateButton( "A", 0.2, 0.1 ); lay.AddChild( btnA ); btnB = app.CreateButton( "B", 0.2, 0.1 ); lay.AddChild( btnB ); btnC = app.CreateButton( "C", 0.2, 0.1 ); lay.AddChild( btnC ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } from native import app def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "Vertical" ) btnA = app.CreateButton( "A", 0.2, 0.1 ) lay.AddChild( btnA ) btnB = app.CreateButton( "B", 0.2, 0.1 ) lay.AddChild( btnB ) btnC = app.CreateButton( "C", 0.2, 0.1 ) lay.AddChild( btnC ) app.AddLayout( lay ) Copy Copy All Run Example - Horizontal function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "Horizontal,FillXY" ); btnA = app.CreateButton( "A", 0.2, 0.1 ); lay.AddChild( btnA ); btnB = app.CreateButton( "B", 0.2, 0.1 ); lay.AddChild( btnB ); btnC = app.CreateButton( "C", 0.2, 0.1 ); lay.AddChild( btnC ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } from native import app def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "Horizontal,FillXY" ) btnA = app.CreateButton( "A", 0.2, 0.1 ) lay.AddChild( btnA ) btnB = app.CreateButton( "B", 0.2, 0.1 ) lay.AddChild( btnB ) btnC = app.CreateButton( "C", 0.2, 0.1 ) lay.AddChild( btnC ) app.AddLayout( lay ) Copy Copy All Run By default Layouts will auto-size to wrap their contents but you have 3 more options as to how a layout sizes within it's parent: “FillX”, “FillY” and “FillXY”. Example - Combined function OnStart() { layVert = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "Vertical,FillXY" ); btnA = app.CreateButton( "A", 0.6, 0.1 ); layVert.AddChild( btnA ); layHoriz = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "Horizontal" ); layVert.AddChild( layHoriz ); btnB1 = app.CreateButton( "B1", 0.2, 0.1 ); layHoriz.AddChild( btnB1 ); btnB2 = app.CreateButton( "B2", 0.2, 0.1 ); layHoriz.AddChild( btnB2 ); btnB3 = app.CreateButton( "B3", 0.2, 0.1 ); layHoriz.AddChild( btnB3 ); btnC = app.CreateButton( "C", 0.6, 0.1 ); layVert.AddChild( btnC ); app.AddLayout( layVert ); } from native import app def OnStart(): layVert = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "Vertical,FillXY" ) btnA = app.CreateButton( "A", 0.6, 0.1 ) layVert.AddChild( btnA ) layHoriz = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "Horizontal" ) layVert.AddChild( layHoriz ) btnB1 = app.CreateButton( "B1", 0.2, 0.1 ) layHoriz.AddChild( btnB1 ) btnB2 = app.CreateButton( "B2", 0.2, 0.1 ) layHoriz.AddChild( btnB2 ) btnB3 = app.CreateButton( "B3", 0.2, 0.1 ) layHoriz.AddChild( btnB3 ) btnC = app.CreateButton( "C", 0.6, 0.1 ) layVert.AddChild( btnC ) app.AddLayout( layVert ) Copy Copy All Run Frame Layouts Frame layouts are used to display objects in front or behind each other. Every time the AddChild function is called on a Frame layout, the child object is placed in a new layer in front of the previously added object at the top left of the frame. Frame Layouts are useful if you wish to do animated Flips or Slides to reveal layers of objects or use transparency. Example - Image Swap function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); layFrm = app.CreateLayout( "Frame" ); img1 = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Droid1.png", 0.5 ); layFrm.AddChild( img1 ); img2 = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Hello.png", 0.5 ); img2.SetVisibility( "Hide" ); layFrm.AddChild( img2 ); lay.AddChild( layFrm ); btn = app.CreateButton( "Press Me" ); btn.SetMargins( 0,0.1,0,0 ); btn.SetOnTouch( btn_OnTouch ); lay.AddChild( btn ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function btn_OnTouch() { if( img2.GetVisibility() == "Hide" ) img2.SetVisibility( "Show" ); else img2.SetVisibility( "Hide" ); } from native import app def OnStart(): global img2 lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) layFrm = app.CreateLayout( "Frame" ) img1 = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Droid1.png", 0.5 ) layFrm.AddChild( img1 ) img2 = app.CreateImage( "/Sys/Img/Hello.png", 0.5 ) img2.SetVisibility( "Hide" ) layFrm.AddChild( img2 ) lay.AddChild( layFrm ) btn = app.CreateButton( "Press Me" ) btn.SetMargins( 0,0.1,0,0 ) btn.SetOnTouch( btn_OnTouch ) lay.AddChild( btn ) app.AddLayout( lay ) def btn_OnTouch(): if img2.GetVisibility() == "Hide": img2.SetVisibility( "Show" ) else: img2.SetVisibility( "Hide" ) Copy Copy All Run Absolute Layouts Absolute layouts ignore all alignment options and allow the absolute positioning of controls by calling the SetPosition and SetSize functions of each of the child objects. However, you are encouraged use linear layouts for most of your programs, unless it is absolutely necessary. Card Layouts Card Layouts are just like frame layouts, but with rounded corners and a shadow by default. They may be used to display offers with an image and optional info text. Methods The following methods are available on the Layout object: AddChild( child, order ) AdjustColor( hue, saturation, brightness, contrast ) Animate( type, callback, time ) Batch( properties ) ChildToFront( child ) ClearFocus() DestroyChild( child ) Focus() GetAbsHeight() → Number: integer GetAbsWidth() → Number: integer GetChildOrder( child ) → Number: integer GetHeight( options ) → Number GetLeft( options ) → Number GetParent() → app object GetPosition( options ) → Object: { left, top, width, height } GetTop( options ) → Number GetType() → String: “Layout” GetVisibility() → String: “Show” or “Hide” or “Gone” GetWidth( options ) → Number Gone() Hide() IsEnabled() → Boolean IsOverlap( obj, depth ) → Boolean IsVisible() → Boolean Method( name, types, p1, p2, p3, p4 ) → all types RemoveChild( child ) SetBackAlpha( alpha ) SetBackColor( color ) SetBackGradient( color1, color2, color3, options ) SetBackGradientRadial( x, y, radius, color1, color2, color3, options ) SetBackground( file, options ) SetChildMargins( left, top, right, bottom, mode ) SetChildTextSize( size, mode ) SetColorFilter( color, mode ) SetCornerRadius( radius ) SetDescription( desc ) SetElevation( elevation ) SetEnabled( enable ) SetGravity( gravity ) SetMargins( left, top, right, bottom, mode ) SetOnChildChange( callback ) SetOnLongTouch( callback ) SetOnTouch( callback ) SetOnTouchDown( callback ) SetOnTouchMove( callback ) SetOnTouchUp( callback ) SetOrientation( orient ) SetPadding( left, top, right, bottom, mode ) SetPosition( left, top, width, height, options ) SetScale( x, y ) SetSize( width, height, options ) SetTouchable( touchable ) SetTouchThrough( through ) SetVisibility( mode ) Show() Tween( target, duration, type, repeat, yoyo, callback ) function( type ) function( src ) function( event ) function( event ) function( event ) function( event )
app/CreateList.htm := CreateList Back CreateList JS Py Hello World Content: - Methods If you want to display many dataset of the same structure you might consider using the List object. lst = app.CreateList( list, width, height, options, delim ) → app object: List The List object supports multi-line list items and can show icons. Multi-line items are created by dividing each list item up using the “:” (colon) character. If you need to use a colon character in your item text then use this character sequence: “^c^”. You can have one icon and some body text using the following formats: “title” “title:icon” “title:body:icon” Alternatively you can use the AddItem method which accepts title, body and icon as parameters to generically build up your list. You can specify your own icon file for example “Img/MyIcon.png”, or one of the special built-in icons using the following key words: “audio”, “photo”, “video”, “folder”, “audiofolder”, “photofolder”, “videofolder” and “playlist”. Example - Title + Icon function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); var data = "Folder:folder,Audio:audio,Photo:photo,Video:video"; lst = app.CreateList( data, 0.8, 0.4 ); lst.SetOnTouch( lst_OnTouch ); lay.AddChild( lst ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function lst_OnTouch( title, body, type, index ) { app.ShowPopup( "Touched Item = " + title ); } from native import app def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) data = "Folder:folder,Audio:audio,Photo:photo,Video:video" lst = app.CreateList( data, 0.8, 0.4 ) lst.SetOnTouch( lst_OnTouch ) lay.AddChild( lst ) app.AddLayout( lay ) def lst_OnTouch( title, body, type, index ): app.ShowPopup( "Touched Item = " + title ) Copy Copy All Run Example - Title + Body function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); var data = "The Hobbit:Author^c^ J.R.R.

The selected item title, body, type and index are passed into your OnTouch callback function as parameters. Example - Simple function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); lst = app.CreateList( "Fred,Bill,Jim", 0.8, 0.4 ); lst.SetOnTouch( lst_OnTouch ); lst.SetOnLongTouch( lst_OnLongTouch ); lay.AddChild( lst ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function lst_OnTouch( title, body, icon, index ) { app.ShowPopup( "Item = " + title + ", Index = " + index, "Short" ); } function lst_OnLongTouch( title, body, icon, index ) { app.ShowPopup( "Long Touch Item = " + title + ", Index = " + index, "Short" ); } from native import app def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) lst = app.CreateList( "Fred,Bill,Jim", 0.8, 0.4 ) lst.SetOnTouch( lst_OnTouch ) lst.SetOnLongTouch( lst_OnLongTouch ) lay.AddChild( lst ) app.AddLayout( lay ) def lst_OnTouch( title, body, icon, index ): app.ShowPopup( "Item = " + title + ", Index = " + str(index), "Short" ) def lst_OnLongTouch( title, body, icon, index ): app.ShowPopup( "Long Touch Item = " + title + ", Index = " + str(index), "Short" ) Copy Copy All Run You can change the look of a List using the SetBackColor and SetTextColor functions on the list object. You can also set a background image/pattern or background gradient for the List using the SetBackground and SetBackGradient functions. Example - Gray on White function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); lst = app.CreateList( "Fred,Bill,Jim", 0.8, 0.4 ); lst.SetTextColor( "#ff666666" ); lst.SetBackColor( "#ffffffff" ); lst.SetOnTouch( lst_OnTouch ); lay.AddChild( lst ); app.AddLayout( lay ); } function lst_OnTouch( title, body, type, index ) { app.ShowPopup( "Touched Item = " + title ); } from native import app def OnStart(): lay = app.CreateLayout( "Linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) lst = app.CreateList( "Fred,Bill,Jim", 0.8, 0.4 ) lst.SetTextColor( "#ff666666" ) lst.SetBackColor( "#ffffffff" ) lst.SetOnTouch( lst_OnTouch ) lay.AddChild( lst ) app.AddLayout( lay ) def lst_OnTouch( title, body, type, index ): app.ShowPopup( "Touched Item = " + title ) Copy Copy All Run You can also create lists items that look like buttons by using one of the following options: “AlumButton”, “GreenButton”, “OrangeButton”.

app/CreateNetClient.htm := CreateNetClient Back CreateNetClient JS Py Hello World Content: - Methods NetClients can be used to communicate with servers on the web. net = app.CreateNetClient( type ) → app object: NetClient You can choose between two different protocols: The connection based TransmissionControlProtocol which always checks if the data was received correctly and in right order. It is used in most cases because it is very reliable. The downside is that it is relatively slow becaus of the numerous checks. The connectionless UserDatagramProtocol which sends the data once without any checks so that packages may be corrupt or lost completely during the transmission. Because of that data can be sent as fast as possible and it suits perfectly for games which need a fast update rate between the devices. Note: A few routers block fast UDP messages by default Example - TCP Basic function OnStart() { lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear" ); web = app.CreateWebView( 1, .5, "ignoreerrors" ); lay.AddChild( web );

Use the SetMessage method to tell the object what to display notify.SetMessage( ticker, title, text ); The Notify method tells it to send the notification: notify.Notify( id ); When the user touches your notification, your app will come to the front, even if it was not running. If you use more than one notification, app.GetNotifyId can be used to check which notification was pressed by the user. Example - Notification function OnStart() { app.ShowPopup( "Sending notification" ); notify = app.CreateNotification(); notify.SetMessage( "Ticker", "Title", "Text" ); notify.Notify( "testID" ); setTimeout( cancel, 5000 ); } function cancel() { notify.Cancel( "testID" ); app.ShowPopup( "Notification cancelled" ); } from hybrid import ui from native import app def OnStart(): global notify app.ShowPopup("Sending notification") notify = ui.Notification() notify.SetMessage("Ticker", "Title", "Text") notify.Notify("testID") app.SetTimeout(cancel, 5000) def cancel(): notify.Cancel("testID") app.ShowPopup("Notification cancelled") Copy Copy All Run Methods The following methods are available on the Notification object: Batch( properties ) Cancel( id ) GetType() → String: “Notification” Listen( options ) Notify( id ) SetLargeImage( image ) SetLights( color, onMs, offMs ) SetMessage( ticker, title, text, extra ) SetOnNotify( callback ) SetSmallImage( image ) function( source, title, message, extra, type )

app/CreateService.htm := CreateService Back CreateService JS Py Hello World Content: - Methods Services run in the background and can be used to monitor online databases, local communication ports or changes in data on the file system. They can also trigger notifications to the user and launch apps when changes or timeouts occur. DroidScript Services run in a separate process and can take advantage of multi-CPU devices, this allows CPU intensive calculations or slow procedures to be done in the background without slowing down or interfering with the main application. Any file in your project with the filename “Service.js” will run as a hidden background service. A service can be created and started using the CreateService method of the app object in your main application file:. srv = app.CreateService( packageName, className, callback, options ) → app object: Service Use “this” for the packageName and className parameters. Your service will start running when it's created and a foreground app must exist to manage the service and this foreground app must be run at least one time by the user. You can set the service to start automatically when the device is booted if required; with the SetAutoBoot method of the app object. app.SetAutoBoot( "Service" ); Stop a service using the Stop method. svc.Stop(); Messages can be sent from your app to the service using the SendMessage method on the service object: svc.SendMessage( msg ); You will need to provide a message handler to receive and process the messages (see example below). Send messages from the service to the main app by using the SendMessage method of the app object: app.SendMessage( msg ); This will also need a message handler on the application (see example below). Adding services to your application is best done working with the WiFi editor (browser IDE) because you will need to edit more than one file and also see debug message from the service. Debug and error messages are shown in gray on the debug tab of the WiFi editor. Pressing the stop button in this IDE will stop both the service and the app, but pressing the back button on your device will stop the app but leave the service running. Example - Services //our Service.js code. //In regular usage move this code to a separate Service.js file var servicejs = ` //Init variables. var count = 0; var diff = 1; //Called when service is started. function OnStart() { app.ShowPopup( "Hello from Service!" ); //Start a timer to do some regular work. setInterval( DoWork, 500 ); } //Called when we get a message from main app. function OnMessage( msg ) { app.Debug( msg ); //Handle commands from main App. if( msg == "change" ) diff = (diff > 0 ? -1 : 1); } //This is where we do some regular background task //(here we just modify a counter and send it back to the app, if its running). function DoWork() { count += diff; app.SendMessage( count ); }` function OnStart() { //Create the Service.js file //(In regular usage create the file yourself) app.WriteFile("Service.js", servicejs ); //Create a layout. lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); //Create text control to display data from the service. txt = app.CreateText( "", 0.4 ); txt.SetTextSize( 22 ); lay.AddChild( txt ); //Create an 'Send Message' button. btn = app.CreateButton( "Send Message to Service", 0.6, 0.1 ); lay.AddChild( btn ); btn.SetOnTouch( function(){ svc.SendMessage("change"); } ); //Create a 'Stop Service' button. btn = app.CreateButton( "Stop Service", 0.6, 0.1 ); lay.AddChild( btn ); btn.SetOnTouch( function(){ svc.Stop(); } ); //Add layout to app. app.AddLayout( lay ); //Start/connect to our service. svc = app.CreateService( "this", "this", OnServiceReady ); svc.SetOnMessage( OnServiceMessage ); //This will cause your service to start at boot. //(Set it to "none" if you need to stop it starting) //app.SetAutoBoot( "Service" ); } //Called after our service has started. function OnServiceReady() { app.Debug( "Service Ready" ); } //Called when messages comes from our service. function OnServiceMessage( msg ) { txt.SetText( "Count: " + msg ); } from native import app #our Service.js code. #In regular usage move this code to a separate Service.js file servicejs = """ #Init variables. count = 0 diff = 1 #Called when service is started. def OnStart(): app.ShowPopup( "Hello from Service!" ) #Start a timer to do some regular work. setInterval( DoWork, 500 ) #Called when we get a message from main app. def OnMessage( msg ): global diff app.Debug( msg ) #Handle commands from main App. if msg == "change": diff = (diff > 0 ? -1 : 1) #This is where we do some regular background task #(here we just modify a counter and send it back to the app, if its running). def DoWork(): count += diff app.SendMessage( count ) """ def OnStart(): global txt #Create the Service.js file #(In regular usage create the file yourself) app.WriteFile("Service.js", servicejs ) #Create a layout. lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) #Create text control to display data from the service. txt = app.CreateText( "", 0.4 ) txt.SetTextSize( 22 ) lay.AddChild( txt ) #Create an 'Send Message' button. btn = app.CreateButton( "Send Message to Service", 0.6, 0.1 ) lay.AddChild( btn ) btn.SetOnTouch( lambda: svc.SendMessage("change") ) #Create a 'Stop Service' button. btn = app.CreateButton( "Stop Service", 0.6, 0.1 ) lay.AddChild( btn ) btn.SetOnTouch( lambda: svc.Stop() ) #Add layout to app. app.AddLayout( lay ) #Start/connect to our service. svc = app.CreateService( "this", "this", OnServiceReady ) svc.SetOnMessage( OnServiceMessage ) #This will cause your service to start at boot. #(Set it to "none" if you need to stop it starting) #app.SetAutoBoot( "Service" ); #Called after our service has started. def OnServiceReady(): app.Debug( "Service Ready" ) #Called when messages comes from our service. def OnServiceMessage( msg ): txt.SetText( "Count: " + msg ) Copy All Run Inspect the debug console and see the log messages from the service in gray.

app/CreateWebServer.htm := CreateWebServer Back CreateWebServer JS Py Hello World Content: - Methods Web servers form the foundation of the web, especially the Internet of Things (IoT). sock = app.CreateWebServer( port, options ) → app object: WebServer Turning your phone or tablet into a web server or creating a network of interconnected devices is very simple with DroidScript. Set a document root for the server using the SetFolder method of the WebServer object. This is the folder location on your device that your web pages will be served from. wbs.SetFolder( path ); Start the server using the Start method. wbs.Start(); And stop it using the Stop method. wbs.Stop(); The following example shows how to create a basic webserver for serving pages over WiFi from your device. It will serve a built in demo page. For simplicity some of the features in the demo page will not work in this first example. Try them and you will see how the server presents errors. The next example shows how to handle all the features of the demo page. Example - Basic function OnStart() { var ip = app.GetIPAddress(); app.Alert( ip +":8080", "Type the following address into your browser" ); serv = app.CreateWebServer( 8080 ); serv.SetFolder( "/sdcard/DroidScript" ); serv.Start(); } from native import app def OnStart(): ip = app.GetIPAddress() app.Alert( ip +":8080", "Type the following address into your browser" ) serv = app.CreateWebServer( 8080 ) serv.SetFolder( "/sdcard/DroidScript" ) serv.Start() Copy Copy All Run The second example shows how to accept file upload and permit directory listings by including permissions in the options parameter of the app.CreateWebServer method. It also adds a servlet to respond to messsages from the web client. A servelet can be used to process data supplied by a user via form elements or it can handle requests made from the client application. To get a better understanding of how client - server messaging works you can view the source of the served demo page and the network view in the developer tools of your favorite browser to see how the simple GET request is sent from the client browser to the servlet for processing by the OnServlet function when the Send Message button is clicked. Example - Servlets function OnStart() { var ip = app.GetIPAddress(); app.Alert( ip +":8080", "Type the following address into your browser" ); serv = app.CreateWebServer( 8080, "Upload,ListDir" ); serv.SetFolder( "/sdcard/DroidScript" ); serv.AddServlet( "/message", OnServlet ); serv.Start(); } function OnServlet( request, info ) { serv.SetResponse( "Got it!" ); app.ShowPopup( info.remoteAddress + " says: " + request.msg ); } from native import app def OnStart(): global serv ip = app.GetIPAddress() app.Alert( ip +":8080", "Type the following address into your browser" ) serv = app.CreateWebServer( 8080, "Upload,ListDir" ) serv.SetFolder( "/sdcard/DroidScript" ) serv.AddServlet( "/message", OnServlet ) serv.Start() def OnServlet( request, info ): serv.SetResponse( "Got it!" ) app.ShowPopup( info.remoteAddress + " says: " + request.msg ) Copy Copy All Run Web sockets are faster than servlets and can be used for both client - server applications or peer-to-peer systems where each connected node is both a client and a server without a centralized server. This makes web sockets very useful for datasharing in multiplayer games. All requests sent to the same servlet will queue up behind each other and are processed in order. The server application is said to be blocking all other requests whilst a servlet completes each task synchronously. Web sockets recieve the request and then start a process to handle the request. When the task is complete any data or messages to be returned will be sent back to the relevant connected clients. In this case the server application is said to be non-blocking or asynchronous. See Also: CreateWebSocket Web sockets can be used for broadcast purposes, for example sending the same message to all connected clients. They can also be used to send different direct messages to a specific one device using the IP address. The following example demonstrates web sockets being used to receive messages from and broadcasting messages to connected devices. Example - Send and Receive messages var indexhtml = ` html> head> title>WebSockets Demo /title> script> var count = 0; function Connect() { // Open web socket to phone. ws = new WebSocket( "ws://" + window.location.host ); ws.onopen = ws_onopen; ws.onmessage = ws_onmessage; ws.onclose = ws_onclose; ws.onerror = ws_onerror; } function Send() { ws.send( "Hello " + count++ ); } function ws_onopen() { id_info.innerHTML = "Socket Open"; } function ws_onmessage( msg ) { id_info.innerHTML = msg.data; } function ws_onclose() { id_info.innerHTML = "Socket Closed"; } function ws_onerror(e) { id_info.innerHTML = "Socket Error: " + e.data; } /script> /head> body> h2>DroidScript WebSockets Demo /h2> div id="id_info">Ready /div> button onclick="Connect()">Connect /button> button onclick="Send()">Send Message /button> /body> /html>`; var count = 0; function OnStart() { // Create the Index.html file // note: in regular use move the html to a separate file app.WriteFile( "Index.html", indexhtml ); ip = app.GetIPAddress(); app.Alert( ip +":8080", "Type the following address into your browser" ); app.PreventWifiSleep(); lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ); txt = app.CreateText( "No connected clients.", 0.8, 0.3, "AutoScale,MultiLine" ); txt.SetTextSize( 22 ); lay.AddChild( txt ); txtMsg = app.CreateText( "", 0.8, 0.3, "AutoScale,MultiLine" ); txtMsg.SetTextSize( 22 ); lay.AddChild( txtMsg ); btn = app.CreateButton( "Send Message", 0.4, 0.1); btn.SetMargins( 0, 0.05, 0, 0 ); btn.SetOnTouch( SendMessage ); lay.AddChild( btn ); app.AddLayout( lay ); serv = app.CreateWebServer( 8080 ); serv.SetFolder( app.GetAppPath() ); serv.SetOnReceive( serv_OnReceive ); serv.Start(); setInterval( ShowConnections, 3000 ); } function ShowConnections() { var clients = serv.GetWebSockClients(); var list = []; for( var i = 0; i clients.length; i++ ) list.push(clients[i].remoteAddress); if(list.length) txt.SetText( list.join("\n") ); } function SendMessage() { serv.SendText( "Hello " + count++ ) } function serv_OnReceive( msg, ip ) { txtMsg.SetText( ip + ": " + msg ); } from native import app indexhtml = """ html> head> title>WebSockets Demo /title> count = 0; function Connect() { // Open web socket to phone. ws = new WebSocket( "ws://" + window.location.host ); ws.onopen = ws_onopen; ws.onmessage = ws_onmessage; ws.onclose = ws_onclose; ws.onerror = ws_onerror; } function Send() { ws.send( "Hello " + count++ ); } function ws_onopen() { id_info.innerHTML = "Socket Open"; } function ws_onmessage( msg ) { id_info.innerHTML = msg.data; } function ws_onclose() { id_info.innerHTML = "Socket Closed"; } function ws_onerror(e) { id_info.innerHTML = "Socket Error: " + e.data; } /head> body> h2>DroidScript WebSockets Demo /h2> div id="id_info">Ready /div> button onclick="Connect()">Connect /button> button onclick="Send()">Send Message /button> /body> /html> """ count = 0 def OnStart(): global txt, serv, ip, txtMsg # Create the Index.html file # note: in regular use move the html to a separate file app.WriteFile( "Index.html", indexhtml ) ip = app.GetIPAddress() app.Alert( ip +":8080", "Type the following address into your browser" ) app.PreventWifiSleep() lay = app.CreateLayout( "linear", "VCenter,FillXY" ) txt = app.CreateText( "No connected clients.", 0.8, 0.3, "AutoScale,MultiLine" ) txt.SetTextSize( 22 ) lay.AddChild( txt ) txtMsg = app.CreateText( "", 0.8, 0.3, "AutoScale,MultiLine" ) txtMsg.SetTextSize( 22 ) lay.AddChild( txtMsg ) btn = app.CreateButton( "Send Message", 0.4, 0.1) btn.SetMargins( 0, 0.05, 0, 0 ) btn.SetOnTouch( SendMessage ) lay.AddChild( btn ) app.AddLayout( lay ) serv = app.CreateWebServer( 8080 ) serv.SetFolder( app.GetAppPath() ) serv.SetOnReceive( serv_OnReceive ) serv.Start() setInterval( ShowConnections, 3000 ) def ShowConnections(): clients = serv.GetWebSockClients() list = [] for client in clients: list.append(client.remoteAddress) if list: txt.SetText( "\n".join(list) ) def SendMessage(): serv.SendText( "Hello " + str(count) ) count += 1 def serv_OnReceive( msg, ip, id): txtMsg.SetText( ip + ": " + msg ) Copy All Run Methods The following methods are available on the WebServer object: AddRedirect( pattern, location ) AddServlet( path, callback ) Batch( properties ) Disconnect( ip, id ) GetType() → String: “WebServer” GetWebSockClients() → List: of objects: [{ remoteAddress, id }] Method( name, types, p1, p2, p3, p4 ) → all types SendText( txt, ip, id ) SetFolder( folder ) SetOnReceive( callback ) SetOnUpload( callback ) SetResponse( text ) SetUploadFolder( folder ) Start() Stop() function( args, info ) function( msg, ip, id ) function( filename, ip )

app/SendIntent.htm := SendIntent Back SendIntent JS Py Hello World Intens can be used to perform an operation between different applications or activities. app.SendIntent( packageName, className, action, category, uri, type, extras, options, callback ) It is basically a passive data structure holding an abstract description of an action to be performed. package name and class name can specify the intent target, but you can also leave them null and define a category instead to let the user choose an application of that categoy. If you expect a callback you have to pass the “result” option. The result code can be -1: operation succeeded 1: user-defined activity results 0: operation canceled Many common usage examples are shown in AppIntents. For more information visit the Android Developer Page. There you can find informations about the activity, category and extra. See Also: GetIntent function( resultCode, data )
app/SendMail.htm := SendMail Back SendMail JS Py Hello World Content: - Using Gmail Send an EMail to someone using the default mail application. The passed argumets will be auto-filled. app.SendMail( address, subject, body, attach, type, options ) GMail will not work due to privacy restrictions. Read more about this in this post by DaveSmart: Using Gmail ”Even though Gmail is the fastest way to get started with sending emails, it is by no means a preferable solution unless you are using OAuth2 authentication. Gmail expects the user to be an actual user not a robot so it runs a lot of heuristics for every login attempt and blocks anything that looks suspicious to defend the user from account hijacking attempts. For example you might run into trouble if your server is in another geographical location – everything works in your dev machine but messages are blocked in production. Additionally Gmail has came up with the concept of 'less secure' apps which is basically anyone who uses plain password to login to Gmail, so you might end up in a situation where one username can send (support for 'less secure' apps is enabled) but other is blocked (support for 'less secure' apps is disabled). When using this method make sure to enable the required functionality by completing the “captcha enable”. Without this, less secure connections won't work. Note: These changes are not recommended to make to your main email account! To prevent having login issues you should either use XOAUTH2 (see details here) or use another provider and preferably a dedicated one like Mailgun or SendGrid or any other. Usually these providers have free plans available that are comparable to the daily sending limits of Gmail. Gmail has a limit of 500 recipients a day (a message with one To and one Cc address counts as two messages since it has two recipients) for @gmail.com addresses and 2000 for Google Apps customers, larger SMTP providers usually offer about 200-300 recipients a day for free.“ See Also: SendSMS, SendFile Example - Example function OnStart() { app.CopyFile( "/Sys/Img/Hello.png", "/sdcard/Hello.png" ); app.SendMail( "myfriend@gmail.com", "MySubject", "Hello", "/sdcard/Hello.png" ); } from native import app def OnStart(): app.CopyFile("/Sys/Img/Hello.png", "/sdcard/Hello.png") app.SendMail("myfriend@gmail.com", "MySubject", "Hello", "/sdcard/Hello.png") Copy Copy All Run

ui/addLayout.htm := addLayout Back addLayout JS Py Hello World Content: - Properties - Methods Adds a layout into your app. lay = ui.addLayout( parent, type, options, width, height ) → Object: Layout Component A layout is the basic ui component of an app. It is where you add other ui components such as buttons, textfields, checkboxes, list, images and many more. To add a layout, simply call the addLayout method of the ui object. There are 4 types of layouts: Linear, Absolute, Frame, and Slide. Layouts are transparent by default but you can set a background color or a background image. You can add child objects to the Layout by passing the layout as parent when initializing a control. By default, Layouts will auto-size to wrap and fit their contents but you have 3 more options as to how layout sizes within it's parent: FillXY, FillX, and FillY. ### Linear Layouts Linear layouts are probably the most common type and are used to organize controls in the Vertical or Horizontal orientation on the screen. You can also pass alignment options. For vertical alignment you can pass Top, VCenter, and Bottom. For horizontal alignment you can pass Left, Center, and Right. These will align your children accordingly. For children spacing, see childSpacing property below. ### Absolute Layouts Absolute layouts ignore all alignment options and allow the absolute positioning of controls by calling the setPosition method of each child control. However, you are encouraged to use linear layouts for most of your programs, unless it is absolutely necessary. ### Frame Layouts Frame layouts are used to display objects in front or behind each other. Everytime a child control is added, the new control is placed in a new layer in front of the previously added control at the top left of the frame. You can then use setPosition method of the child control to position it relative to the frame. ### Slide Layouts Slide layouts are used to display carousels or swipeable contents. The same as the Frame layout, this will add a new layer when a new control is added with a swipeable behaviour. You can pass alignment options to align your children within the Slide layout layer. Please note that Vertical and Horizontal options will be the direction of the swipe. If your parent layout is of type Slide, do not add setOnTouch callback handler in order for the slide layout to work perfectly.
