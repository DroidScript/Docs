 This sample demonstrates communicating via the primary UART port of
 the BananaPi zero. (GND,Rx,Tx pins near the mini HDMI connector).

 You can easily test this app on Windows with the PuTTY program by
 connecting a USB->UART converter to the GPIO pins (converters can
 easily found in ebay for a few dollars).

 Sample originally tested with the Kitkat image released on 2018-07-09
