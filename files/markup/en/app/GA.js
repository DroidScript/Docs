/** @Description
With **G**oogle **A**nalytics implemented via analytics.js you can track the use of your apps in real-time and watch as people are using it all over the planet and see what city they are in. You can get lots of usage statistics including what version of your app they are using, what version of Android, the time of day they are using your app, what device they are using and even which parts of the app people are using the most.

You can find more informations on the [Google Developers page](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/command-queue-reference).
