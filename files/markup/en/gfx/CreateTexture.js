 * @brief Returns a new texture object
 * Creates a base texture for Sprites. Using textures is recommended if mand sprites use the same texture and is supposed to be faster because the texture needs to be loaded only once and is then shared across the sprites.
 * $$ gfx.CreateTexture(file) $$
 * @param {str_pth} file
 * @returns gvo-Texture
